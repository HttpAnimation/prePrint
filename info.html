            ## Shipping outside of the US?
            We do not ship outside of the US as of now unless the model is paid for.

            ## Returns
            Returns are not accepted unless it's our fault. If it's the shipper's fault, you will need to make a claim
            with them.

            ## Custom
            Custom models are not supported as of now, but soon will be. You will need to send the model to us first
            before any price can be quoted.
